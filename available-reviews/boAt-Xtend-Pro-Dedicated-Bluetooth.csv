It has dial pad also, you can dial the number and call to anyone, specially i liked this feature. Reasonable price and timely delivery', 'I do not recommend buying this product! The bluetooth calling is good no doubt but once you connect it with your phone you can only talk with watch even if you pick it from phone which is soo irritating. There is no option to transfer to phone & once you turn off the feature you do not even receive a msg when call is incoming. I cannot even return this.', 'Worst Purchase ever, never purchase if you want it for call feature', ""Battery backup very bad it's coming only 5 or 6 hours please change the watch please send as soon as possible"", 'When I driving a car that time this watch very useful for me excellent amazing voice qualityis', 'I have ordered this product & recieved but within a week, the speaker stopped working.

Amoled Display is super, usable at very low or low brightness level. TFT and LCD watches looks terrible after using this.2. Touch Response is good.3. Speaker sound and quality is good for calling and music.4. Steps counter looks correct, can't say accurate.5. ASAP charge is real, other devices are very slow compared to this.6. Fonts and icons are nice,i have seen some watches with very bad color fonts and layout.Cons:1.Watch speaker will be selected by default when you accept a call from mobile too, which is annoying.it should only use it if the call is accepted from the watch.2. Whether location is not accurate, may be app problem.3. Steps history in watch has a view of 1 week but only show current day details, whereas sleep data of mon to sun can be seen.4. Not sure if BPM and SP02 are accurate.5. It has a speaker but alarm don't have any sound only vibrates ‚òπÔ∏è6. 1 biggest missing i feel is, it doesn't automatically identifies our activity like walking/running/activities, it only calculates total steps. For each modes we need to select the type of activity manually which is plenty of available.7. Steps are not syncing with Google fit, sleep and bpm syncs fine.Concl:There are lots of good features in watch but the app or software is not utilising it 100%, most of the  issues can be solved by software update i hope so.I would say don't buy for RS 3500 If these issues are solved. May be worth 2500 to 3000 range because above 3500 you can get other good brands too.üì¢üì¢üì¢ BUYING ANY SMART WATCH, BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AT SAME TIMEüì¢üì¢üì¢"", ""Not working, only worked for two days and then no charge.

Once you have connected bluetooth calling, even if you pickup your calls through phone, it'll automatically get transfered to the watch which is a bit annoying.However  once u have answered the call you get a option on watch to transfer the call to the phone.2. There's no option to silent the call notification on your watch. Either you put it on DND mode in which case you will get no notification on your watch or else your watch will ring once you have a phone call.However, u can mute the ring tone once it starts ringing by pressing the crown button.3. The alarm provided is not of much importance as it only vibrates softly for only 10 seconds. It does'nt rings at all. Neither I found any setting to make it ring.If anyone can make it ring please let me know.4. Sleep tracker doesnt works well. Last night I slept for 11 hours but it shows only 6.5 hours.5. The option to find my watch in the app is of no use if it's gonna just vibrate instead of using its speaker for better locating.6. Day and date is not shown in AOD feature7. Day is missing in customised faces. Only time and date is shown8. Double tap to wake and sleep feature if present could have made the watch more useful.This is all what I noticed after using the watch for a day."", 'Nice features, easy to navigate', 'Do not buy this watch waste of money.
